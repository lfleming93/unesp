Ruby 19 introduces many significant changes over the 18 series Examples

block local variables
an additional lambda syntax
per-string character encodings are supported
new socket API
require_relative import security
Ruby 19 has been obsolete since February 23 2015 and it will no longer receive bug and security fixes Users are advised to upgrade to a more recent version
Ruby 20
Ruby 20 added several new features including
method keyword arguments
a new method Moduleprepend for extending a class
a new literal for creating an array of symbols
new API for the lazy evaluation of Enumerables and
a new convention of using to_h to convert objects to Hashes
Ruby 20 is intended to be fully backward compatible with Ruby 193 As of the official 200 release on February 24 2013 there were only five known  incompatibilities
It has been obsolete since February 22 2016  and it will no longer receive bug and security fixes Users are advised to upgrade to a more recent version
